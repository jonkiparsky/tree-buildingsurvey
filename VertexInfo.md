# Introduction #
VertexInfo contains the information about a [Vertex](Vertex.md) object.



# Details #

A Node is converted into a [Vertex](Vertex.md) for scoring. The Vertex has a set of properties which are encapsulated in the VertexInfo class for convenience. The Vertex is of a Type (ORGANISM or EMPTY), which is calculated from the presence or absence of an associated image. Other properties are taken directly from the [Node](Node.md) in question.
