If you click the "Log in" button and the applet fails to appear, please add a comment under [Issue 34](https://code.google.com/p/tree-buildingsurvey/issues/detail?id=34) "Applet fails to load..." with the details of your OS (ie, Mac OS 10.5.8)  and browser (ie, Firefox 3.6.7).

Mac users:
  * To find out what OS you're running, open "About this Mac" under the Apple menu.
  * While you're in "About this Mac", please tell us what processor you're using.
  * if you find that the applet fails to load, we have had good luck running it under [iCab](http://www.icab.de). The trial version is a free download, and it's a pretty quick install.

Linux Users:
  * You probably know what version of linux you're running. Please tell us.
